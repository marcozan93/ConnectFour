# ConnectFour game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the ConnectFour game in Java which allows to practice the principles of
object-oriented programming. This project has been documented as part of a post on Medium which can be accessed
[here](https://medium.com/@marcozaninitaly/4b5cc0a9f0b2). The post includes additional details about the project and
its implementation, including the UML diagram.

## How to play
The game is played between two players, a human player and a "smart" robot.

The interface includes a 6x7 board with "Drop" buttons on top of each column
which allow the human player to drop its token in the specified column by clicking on
the "Drop" button.

The aim of the game is to connect four tokens either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

## How to run
The game can be run by cloning this repository and running the ```Play.java``` file

In addition, a ```.dmg``` file is available for macOS users, which should allow to install the game on your local
machine as any other macOS application. Further details about this process are presented in the 
Medium post https://medium.com/@marcozaninitaly/4b5cc0a9f0b2.
